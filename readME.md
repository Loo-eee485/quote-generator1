GUIDED PROJECT
This goal of this project was to generate a random quote generator using an api.
There is also an alternate JavaScript file in case the api should fail to work. 
The alternate file would access the local quotes.js file for the random quotes.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript were used to create this project
